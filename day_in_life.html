      <li class="malcom"> Hark, On the horizon! A passage of interest!
      <li><em>1200</em>-- A Mast appears from the north, flags mark it as a Scandanavian ship. The size implies a transport vessel. Night and day crew are gathered to man
        the battalions.</li>
      <li><em>0100</em>-- The ship appears to be turning course, we set ours to follow theres, roll external sweeps toward the north and set chase.</li>
      <li><em>0200</em>-- The Serpant is astride the ship, firing at will, we throw the planks out and the gun-crew boards, capturing who they
        can, injuring who they can't.</li>
      <li class="malcom"> 3 men injured on our end, 5 on their's thus far.</li>
      <li><em>0300</em>-- The ship (Marina's Sun) has been successfully over taken. None of the serpants crew were lost only 4 injured- 1 dead, 6 wounded from the Marina's Crew. I find the captain, ludvik Hastain hogtied in the bow.</li>
      <li class="malcom"> Lewin took a musket ball to the shoulder, Clemence, a knife wound in the side, Rollo has a 2-inch deep gash to the arm and back, Phillips, a musket ball to the leg. I set about treating their wounds with the boatswain.</li>
      <li><em>0300</em>-- Marina's Sun appears to be under a lumber supplier/trader, bringing ship paneling, and iron work into the queen's land. The Sun's urgent-injured crewman are treated using their supplies after our men are fully treated. We do not kill when we need not.</li>
      <li><em>0400</em>-- 3/4ths of their trades are hoisted while the sun's crew watch, we leave their food, but take 2/3rds of the captains chest, filled with coin to purchase goods.</li>
      <li class="malcom" id="dont"> Captain is kind with our thievery.</li>
      <li> Rowland sullies the transcript with lies.</li>
      <li><em>0500</em>-- Our Crew is finished Hauling, we cut the rope of their Barrelman at gun point, they may untie the others when they reach 4 leagues away. Any shorter and our cannon takes the base of their ship.
      <li class="malcom"> For Posterity: The snake does not carry a cannon. Captain claims them to be cumbersome. </li>

      <li><em>0600</em>-- Ww are 3 naughts away, our guncrew stays aimed at the Sun. We continue to treat the injured. Night crew and injured are sent to barracks to rest.</li>
        <li class"malcom"> Day crew are rowdy at having to clean up the mess on their own, but night crew have not rested and all respect the captain's orders.</li>
      <li><em>0700</em>-- Food is sent to the barracks and deck, cured meat, cheese, bread and ale.</li>
        <li class="malcom"> Rousing songs of victory are sung.</li>
      <li><em>0800</em>-- Crew set's about repearing the main damage using curing paste and plaster. Sails are taken down individually for sewing 3, 4, 2, and 2 musket-tears respectively.</li>
      <li><em>0900</em>-- Guns are reloaded, and the haul is positioned securely in the helm.</li>
      <li><em>1000</em>-- Captain and First Mate add booty to the running catalog, reset course direction to port relative to value.</li>
        <li class="malcom"> The Serpant slithers southward toward the Morrocan ports. To increase our value, we will trade where compensation is the highest and fetch a pretty</li>
          penny for the spices gained back in the northern ports.</li>
      <li><em>1100</em>-- Captain retires to cabin, day crew is sent to barracks, and night crew returns for work.</li>
